<h4>What does it mean?</h4>
My result on the Myers-Briggs test has grouped me in the “Logician” character type. ‘Logicians are known for their brilliant theories and unrelenting logic – in fact, they are considered the most logically precise of all the personality types’ (16 Personalities n.d., para. 3). This means that in comparison to the rest of the population, 16 Personalities considers those who answered similarly to me as people more driven primarily by logic, who work on their own terms for their own ends, and who usually struggle with emotional connections and being overwhelmed by external stimuli. I can personally echo some of this, in that I do generally prefer to work at my own pace on whatever task I deem most important at the time. However, the overall results lack nuance, as would be expected by attempting to group every personality in the world into one of just 16 types (plus subtypes). It is interesting to gain some insights into how my brain appears to tick based on my answers to some questions, and also how that relates with others.
<h4>How does it influence my working in a team?</h4>
16 Personalities indicates that while Logicians prefer to work alone, they do their best work when part of a team. This is because having other team members can allow the Logicians to bounce their ideas off of others, and more importantly make sure that nothing is missed due to focus in another area. I find that working with others allows me to contribute in areas in specialise in, including digesting and refining ideas and justifying different approaches; while helping with my weaknesses such as presenting in a format suitable for a wider audience.
<h4>So what’s it mean when forming a team?</h4>
I believe as does Hunt (2006, para. 3) that the ‘definition of a team is one in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts’. I believe in gathering people different people with varying strengths and weaknesses is far more effective than gathering similar individuals with similar characteristics. This means that the strengths of each team member can really shine, and the weaknesses of each can be mitigated through the contributions of others. What this suggests for someone of the Logician personality type is that I should attempt to find team members who are perhaps more extroverted, or perhaps use emotion more when making decisions.

<h3>Learning style test (EducationPlanner.org, 2020)
<p>Auditory: 20%
<br>Visual: 60%
<br>Tactile: 20%</p></h3>
<h4>What does it mean?</h4>
This learning test from EducationPlanner.org shows that I am quite strongly a visual learner, with a definite predilection for retaining information that I see. This goes well with online learning, as much of the content is delivered visually in either text or images. I agree with the results of this test as I’ve always found it easier to retain information that I see, and can sometimes struggle to retain information that I’ve heard. I’ve also found that writing something down is a great way to remember it – even if I never refer to those notes again. Keeping this in mind as I continue my studies will help set me up for success.
<h4>How does it influence my working in a team?</h4>
While this can not be wholly attributed to my being a visual learner, I find written communication the most effective method for me to both contribute and receive information. This means that I prefer to collaborate via email or messaging, as opposed to voice calls or video conferences. While it would be helpful for me to communicate exclusively in this way, I will need to be flexible and understanding of others’ learning styles when working in a group.
<h4>So what’s it mean when forming a team?</h4>
When forming a team, I should be on the lookout for those sharing my learning style, as it will make organising and working together an easier experience. I don’t believe that this should be the main priority, however, as this is something that can be worked around.

<h3>The Big 5 Test (Rubynor, 2020)</h3>
<div style="float:right;font-family:Times New Roman;text-align:center">
<img src="big5border.jpg" alt="Big 5 Result" style="float:right;width:450px;height:300px">
<p><b>Figure 2</b> by Rubynor 2020
</div>
<h3>Openness: 80 (high)
<br>Neuroticism: 86 (high)
<br>Extraversion: 56 (low)
<br>Conscientiousness: 62 (low)
<br>Agreeableness: 59 (low) </h3>

<h4>What does it mean?</h4>
My results on the Big 5 test can suggest a number of things, as interpreted by Coach Tony (2016). My high openness score suggests that I am open to new experiences and prefer that over a fixed routine. My high neuroticism score suggests that I am prone to stress. My low extraversion score suggests that I tend to be solitary and reserved. My low conscientiousness score suggests that I am easy-going, and sometimes careless. My low agreeableness score suggests I am more analytic and detached. I believe that all of this combined translated into my own experience means that I like to try new things, but can stress about the result, so I try to be easy-going and take it as it comes. I also prefer to go my own way, and carefully analyse a situation before jumping in.
<h4>How does it influence my working in a team?</h4>
At first glance, the relatively high neuroticism trait with low extraversion combines to give an impression that I would be a very passive team member, with little to offer but stress and criticism. In fact, this couldn’t be further from the truth. I enjoy encouraging others to input their ideas, and while I will often have feedback, it’s usually constructive. I know that when in a team we are working together for mutual gains, and so it pays to be proactive and work together. I likely make a more deliberate effort to do this because of my natural tendency to stay in the background – I know from experience that that will not lead to the best result.
<h4>So what’s it mean when forming a team?</h4>
Similar to my response to the Myers-Briggs test, I believe that finding people with different results will lead to the best outcome when working in a group. Accordingly, this means I should find people more cautious, calm, friendly, outgoing and organised, as Coach Tony (2016) lists these as traits of those who scored opposite to me in the Big 5 test.
