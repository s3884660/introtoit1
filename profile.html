Hi, I’m Al, born in Perth and raised in a WA country town called Capel. I’m now back to living in Perth, with my fiancée and two cats. I work in an administrative role for a certain major Australian Telco, which combined with study means I don’t have a lot of free time. However when I do have it, what I enjoy doing is gaming, primarily video games; I’m a former World of Warcraft player and I like RTS games. One might say I have a particular set of skills, which allow me to… play no better than the average player. I play for fun, and I’ve never been great at ranked play.

I have just begun studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University, and I am returning to study after a break of about 14 years. As I live in Perth, and RMIT is located in Melbourne, this naturally means that I am studying online. This appeals to me as it gives me the means to study flexibly, on my own schedule. I am also fortunate with my current role at work that allows some flexibility with hours, which combined with the 3 hour time difference allows me to attend the majority of live lectures and tutorials.
	<h4>Interest in IT</h4>
I’ve had an interest in IT since I was in high school, taking a robotics class in year 8. This class involved making models out of Lego, that had motors and switches and lights. We were able to program the behaviour of these parts using a program that graphically represented logic gates. We worked in pairs, and while my partner made incredible Lego creations, I would program its behaviour. One example is we made a rocket ship with a button on top and on the bottom; it was designed such that when the rocket hit the top of its enclosure, the top switch would activate and reverse the direction of the motor inside, and again at the bottom. I kept this interest in programming through to upper secondary, where I would program relatively complex games or methods for solving maths and physics problems on my graphics calculator. This is where my experience in programming ends, however, so while I know well if/while/else loops, everything else I study will be new to me.
	<h4>How I came to be at RMIT</h4>
A few months ago, I went out for some delicious ramen with my fiancée Felicia, her sister Claire and Claire’s fiancé Mosese. While we were out, Mosese spoke of how he was studying a History degree through a university he found through Open Universities Australia (OUA). This got me to thinking of how I’d been considering a change in career for a while, but lacked the qualifications to progress. I thought about how I’ve always had an interest in IT, programming in particular, and researched how I might be able to get there through online study. I researched and compared the different courses available through OUA, and RMIT’s Bachelor of Information Technology seemed like the best fit for me, with multiple programming units. The number of IT electives mean that I will be able to focus my direction down what interests me the most, and I will discover more about exactly what that is as I study my degree. I also researched reviews of the university, and of the course, which were favourable. With the opportunity to study at a respected university on a customisable course that would enable me to develop and explore my interests, my path was set. I enrolled, and Felicia bought me an Irn-Bru (one of the world’s finest beverages) to celebrate.
	<h4>What I expect to learn from my studies</h4>
From my studies I expect to learn exactly what part of the IT industry is most suited to me, and the skills required to get me there. Entering the course, I know that I have an interest in fixing problems, and in programming, but I don’t know yet exactly what job is going to be ideally suited and where exactly my skills lie. Through completing the units in the Bachelor of IT course to the best of my ability, I hope to find this out.
